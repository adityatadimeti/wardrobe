                    This was my favorite class of Spring quarter. The instruction was pretty stellar and I
                    established a solid proof writing foundation. The content was also entirely different from
                    anything I'd seen in the past. The course was a lot more focused on the theoretical foundations of
                    computing. I think theory courses inherently suffer from a lower utility compared to coding-based CS courses,
                    but as an intro to CS theory I really enjoyed the course.

                  <li>
                    Required writing class. Among the more chill PWR classes with instruction that avoided lecture heavy classes, which I appreciated.
                    My writing skills probably improved through the workshops / required essays. If you're looking to learn about numbers
                    and metrics, this probably isn't what you're expecting, as the bulk of the learning comes through the research
                    you do for the essays.

                    This class was... a lot. <a class="subtlelink" target="_blank" href="https://carta-beta.stanford.edu/">Carta </a>
                    reviews were pretty cautionary: unclear instruction coupled with esoteric exams and vague
                    assignment specs make for an overall negative experience. My experiences were largely similar. I would say
                    that I thought the Photo Sharing assignments were where I learned the most. The lectures are usually unrelated
                    to the current assignment, but they're directly related to exam content (which covered entirely theoretical material
                    that I generally felt had low practical utility). Mendel Rosenblum does post all his past exams, which was
                    transparent and useful, so you know what to expect. I took it alone, and looking back I wish I had more friends to collaborate with
                    during the later weeks as the assignments became increasingly challenging. The course's open internet / Stack Overflow policy was
                    a blessing.

                    <p>
                      Utility of 3.5 because the assignments were directly relevant to web development skills, but I felt the lecture/exam content was
                      too theoretical to be useful. Probably would take again, but only if I had more friends to lean on.

                    Extremely foundational course. The content was very clear and the instruction was fantastic —
                    really enjoyed Chris Piech's enthusiasm during lectures. The assignments were a mix of
                    probability problems and coding, which was really great to directly see probability applied. The
                    final was pretty rough but that was to remedy the inflated averaged after an easy-ish midterm.

                    Another foundational course. This course was hard — famously known as the weed-out course
                    in the CS department — but I made it through thanks to some late nights in
                    weeks 7-10. Chris Gregg was a great instructor who was understanding and accomodative. The final
                    assignment, building a heap allocator, took nearly 4 full days to complete. This was the first
                    college course to really push me (I'm sure the first of many).

                    Required course to fulfill my language credits. Fully virtual, but met every day for 1 hour. Pretty low
                    workload, and Juan Valdez was a really enjoyable instructor to learn from. I wasn't expecting to like
                    the class, but the emphasis on projects and learning over stringent assignments was really great.

                    Iconic intro CS course. Made lots of friends through this and got a rigorous introduction to C++.
                    The content was presented in an interesting and engaging way. Also taught me time management:
                    this was my first ever class where all assignments were due weekly.

                    Met some cool people, but the classes week to week were pretty disjoint. The content we learned was interesting, but it was more surface level than I expected (though adequate for 1 unit class). One of the
                    Dynamic Programming concepts we covered did help me secure an internship freshman summer, though, so that was nice.

                    106B uses their own modified version of C++, which is why 106L was a great complement. Really low workload
                    and the lectures were pretty clear. Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn C++ beyond the handholding
                    Stanford does. Fair warning though, it was super easy to get by this course without paying attention to lectures.
                    You get out what you put in, which is consistent with a lot of courses here.

                    I wanted to like this course more than I did, but I thought it offered a fresh perspective on what
                    the benefits of college are. Inspired me a bit to diversify my studying here and the biggest takeaway
                    I got was that complementing your intended major with unrelated courses is beneficial to your overall
                    intellectual journey.

                    Fairly decent introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calculus. The instruction was great but
                    fast-paced, and the 2nd midterm + final were pretty challenging. Overall good intro to what a
                    lecture based college class looks like, and I was able to make some of my best friends through this course.
