                <p>
                    I worked full time as an NLP intern for Project Ronin in the Data Science team between April and June 2022. I will return full time in September.

                <p>
                    I analyzed the performance of the NLP team's NER models for symptom extraction, and am currently in the process of
                    crafting an end to end pipeline for sectionizing oncology clinical notes. This involves annotating notes in
                    John Snow Labs, using rule-based regex tools, and using tools like transformers/Medspacy for the sectionizing process.
