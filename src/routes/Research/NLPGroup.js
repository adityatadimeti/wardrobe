                <p>
                    I joined the Stanford NLP group my first quarter at Stanford. I shadowed a PhD and learned some NLP fundamentals. I did a bit of
                    data analysis for the project my team worked on: analying social media data to gauge public sentiment regarding
                    climate policies. I ended my work in January 2022, though I plan to return to the NLP group in the near future.
