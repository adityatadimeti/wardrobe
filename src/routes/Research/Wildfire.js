                <p>
                    I joined the Global Environmental Change Lab at UC Davis as a Machine Learning intern during my sophomore year of high school.
                    I worked with Professor Erwan Monier for a little over two years to develop ML models to predict the size of wildfires prior to ignition. I presented
                    the research at the AGU Fall Meeting in 2019 and <Link class="textlink" to="/Portfolio/Harker">won some awards</Link> with the research.
